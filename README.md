## Introduction

**Multi-Threaded YOLOv7 ONNX With OpenCV** is a GitHub repository that implements the YOLOv7 object detection model using ONNX for inference and leverages OpenCV for real-time video and image processing. It's designed to provide high-performance, real-time object detection, making it suitable for various computer vision applications.

## Features

- Real-time object detection with YOLOv7 using ONNX.
- Multi-threaded inference for improved speed.
- Customizable for different YOLOv7 configurations and datasets.
